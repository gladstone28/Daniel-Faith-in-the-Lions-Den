### Act 1: The Test of Faith

**Scene 1: The Royal Selection**

*(The stage is set in the king’s court. Ashpenaz stands before Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.)*

**Narrator:** In the land of Babylon, King Nebuchadnezzar ordered that young men from Israel be brought to his court. Among them were Daniel and his friends, known for their wisdom and knowledge.

**Ashpenaz:** (Holding a platter of food) You are to eat from the king's table and drink of his wine.

**Daniel:** (Steps forward) We cannot defile ourselves with the king's food. Give us only vegetables and water for ten days, then compare us to the others.

**Ashpenaz:** (Hesitant) Very well. We shall see the results in ten days.

### Scene 2: The Outcome of the Test

*(Ten days later, Ashpenaz examines Daniel and his friends.)*

**Ashpenaz:** Remarkable! You are healthier and stronger than any of the others. You may continue with your chosen diet.

**Narrator:** Because of their faithfulness, God granted Daniel and his friends knowledge and wisdom. To Daniel, He gave the ability to interpret dreams and visions.

### Act 2: The Fiery Furnace

**Scene 1:** The Golden Image

*(A large golden image is placed on stage. King Nebuchadnezzar stands before the people.)*

**King Nebuchadnezzar:** (Commanding voice) When you hear the sound of music, you must fall down and worship this golden image I have set up. Whoever does not obey will be thrown into a fiery furnace!

*(Music plays. Everyone bows except Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.)*

**Conspirator 1:** (Pointing) These men refuse to bow, O king!

**King Nebuchadnezzar:** (Furious) Is it true? If you do not worship, you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace. What god will rescue you from my hand?

**Shadrach:** We do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.

**Meshach:** If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us.

**Abednego:** But even if He does not, we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold.

### Scene 2: Divine Deliverance

*(The three are thrown into the furnace. Flames appear on stage. The king watches in shock.)*

**King Nebuchadnezzar:** (Astonished) Didn't we throw three men into the fire? But I see four men, walking around unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!

*(Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego come out unharmed.)*

**King Nebuchadnezzar:** (Awestruck) Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego!

### Act 3: The Writing on the Wall

**Scene 1:** Belshazzar’s Feast

*(King Belshazzar is feasting with his guests. They drink from the sacred vessels from the Jerusalem Temple.)*

**King Belshazzar:** (Laughing) Bring me the vessels from the Temple of Jerusalem, let us drink and praise the gods of gold and silver!

*(A mysterious hand appears, writing on the wall. The king is terrified.)*

**King Belshazzar:** (Trembling) What does this mean? Someone, interpret these words!

**Scene 2:** The Judgment

*(Daniel is brought in.)*

**Daniel:** The words are "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN." It means: God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end; you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting; your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

**Narrator:** That very night, Belshazzar was slain, and Darius the Mede took the kingdom.

### Act 4: The Lion’s Den

**Scene 1:** The Decree and the Trap

*(King Darius sits on his throne. Conspirators approach him.)*

**Conspirator 1:** O king, issue a decree that anyone who prays to any god or man except you in the next thirty days shall be thrown into the lion's den.

**King Darius:** (Writing the decree) It is done. Let it be proclaimed.

*(Daniel is seen praying at a window.)*

**Conspirator 2:** (Pointing) Look, Daniel continues to pray three times a day, ignoring your decree, O king!

### Scene 2: The Den of Lions

*(Daniel is thrown into the lion's den. The king watches in despair.)*

**King Darius:** (Worried) May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!

*(A stone is rolled over the entrance. Night falls, and in the morning, the king rushes to the den.)*

**King Darius:** Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God been able to rescue you?

**Daniel:** (From inside the den) My God sent His angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me.

### Scene 3: Divine Protection

*(Daniel is lifted out of the den, unharmed.)*

**King Darius:** (Proclaiming) I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom, people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.

**Narrator:** And so, Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian, a testament to the power of unwavering faith and the deliverance of God.
